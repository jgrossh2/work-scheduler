# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
# Description

Work Day Scheduler was created to keep track of daily tasks. Based on the standard workday of 9am-5pm, there are text areas to enter notes, or tasks that correspond to the hour of the day. When the hour is current, the row will be green, when the hour is passed, the row will be gray, and when the hour is in the future, the row will be blue.
